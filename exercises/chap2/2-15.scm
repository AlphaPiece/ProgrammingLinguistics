;;; Eva Lu Ator, another user, has also noticed the different intervals
;;; computed by different but algebraically equivalent expressions. She
;;; says that a formula to compute with intervals using Alyssaâ€™s system
;;; will produce tighter error bounds if it can be written in such a
;;; form that no variable that represents an uncertain number is repeated.
;;; Thus, she says, par2 is a "better" program for parallel resistances
;;; than par1. Is she right? Why?

;;; par2 does produce a tighter error bounds.
