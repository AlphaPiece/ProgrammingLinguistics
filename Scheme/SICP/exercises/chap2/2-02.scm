;;;; Exercise 2.2

;;; Consider the problem of representing line segments in a plane.
;;; Each segment is represented as a pair of points: a starting
;;; point and an ending point. Define a constructor make-segment
;;; and selectors start-segment and end-segment that define the
;;; representation of segments in terms of points. Furthermore,
;;; a point can be represented as a pair of numbers: the x coordinate
;;; and the y coordinate. Accordingly, specify a constructor
;;; make-point and selectors x-point and y-point that define
;;; this representation. Finally, using your selectors and
;;; constructors, define a procedure midpoint-segment that takes
;;; a line segment as argument and returns its midpoint (the point
;;; whose coordinates are the average of the coordinates of the
;;; endpoints). To try your procedures, youâ€™ll need a way to print
;;; points:

(define (print-point p)
  (newline)
  (display "(")
  (display (x-point p))
  (display ",")
  (display (y-point p))
  (display ")"))

(define (make-segment p1 p2) (cons p1 p2))
(define (start-segment s) (car s))
(define (end-segment s) (cdr s))

(define (make-point x y) (cons x y))
(define (x-point p) (car p))
(define (y-point p) (cdr p))

(define (average x y)
  (/ (+ x y) 2.0))
(define (midpoint-segment s)
  (make-point (average (x-point (start-segment s))
                       (x-point (end-segment s)))
              (average (y-point (start-segment s))
                       (y-point (end-segment s)))))

(define p1 (make-point 1 2))
(define p2 (make-point 4 1))
(define s (make-segment p1 p2))
(print-point p1)
(print-point p2)
(print-point (midpoint-segment s))
