;;; Yes, the two procedures product the same result for every tree. The
;;; lists the two procedures produce are always sorted.
;;; Both procedures will produce (1 3 5 7 9 11) for all the trees in
;;; figure 2.16.

;;; b.
;;;
;;; Yes, the two procedures have the same order of growth, which is Î˜(n).
;;; But since tree->list-1 uses an additional procedure append, it will
;;; cost more computational resourse (run slower) than tree->list-2.
