# SchemeChangesWorld

## *World is different with Scheme.*

Scheme is a dialect of LISP. And I believe learning LISP can make me become a better programmer.

All exercises are from the book Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (SICP).

The final goal of SICP is to teach you to build a interpreter of Scheme.
